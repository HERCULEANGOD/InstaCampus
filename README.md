Proposal for INSTACAMPUS

To address the challenge of fragmented university communications, we propose developing INSTACAMPUS, a centralized mobile application that consolidates all university-related information. This platform will provide real-time updates on club activities, event schedules, announcements from various departments, and enable direct communication with club heads and faculty. By creating this centralized hub, we aim to ensure that students and faculty stay informed and engaged with campus life, reducing delays and encouraging greater participation.

Project Phases
Phase 1: Develop the core features of the platform, including user authentication, event schedule management, and real-time notifications.
Phase 2: Conduct user testing and gather feedback from students and faculty.
Phase 3: Enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) and expand mobile support in future updates.
